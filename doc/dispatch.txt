INTRODUCTION                                    *dispatch*

Leverage the power of Vim's compiler system without being constrained by
synchronicity.

COMMANDS                                        *dispatch-commands*

                                                *dispatch-:Make*
:Make [arguments]       Using the current |:compiler| settings, dispatch a
                        build in the foreground.  Adapter strategies vary, but
                        the goal is visibility without stealing focus.  When
                        the build is complete, load the results into the
                        |quickfix| list and call |:cwindow|.  This command is
                        preferred for shorter tasks like "build this file."

:Make! [arguments]      Using the current compiler settings, dispatch a build
                        in the background.  Use |:Copen| to load the results.
                        This command is preferred for longer tasks like "run
                        the entire test suite."

                                                *dispatch-:Copen*
:Copen                  Load the latest build into the quickfix list and open
                        it with |:copen|.  You may call this before the
                        process is finished.

:Copen!                 Load the latest build into the quickfix list using a
                        catch-all parser.  This is useful when you can't tell
                        what went wrong.

                                                *dispatch-:Dispatch*
:Dispatch[!] {program} [arguments]
                        Find a compiler plugin that sets 'makeprg' to
                        {command} and use its 'errorformat' to dispatch a
                        |:Make| for the given {command} and [arguments].  If
                        no compiler plugin is found, the generic format
                        %+G%.%# is used.

                        :Dispatch picks a compiler by looking for
                        CompilerSet makeprg={program} in compiler plugins.
                        To force a given {program} to use a given {compiler},
                        create ~/.vim/after/compiler/{compiler}.vim and add to
                        it a line like the following: >

                        " CompilerSet makeprg={program}
<
                                                *b:dispatch*
:Dispatch[!]            Invoke |:Dispatch| with the command and arguments
                        found in b:dispatch.  When absent, equivalent to
                        |:Make|.

                                                *dispatch-:FocusDispatch*
:FocusDispatch {program} [arguments]
                        Set a global default command for |:Dispatch| with no
                        arguments.  Overrides |b:dispatch|.

:FocusDispatch! {program} [arguments]
                        Set a window local default command for |:Dispatch|
                        with no arguments.  Overrides |b:dispatch| and the
                        global default.

:FocusDispatch!         Clear the global and window local defaults for
                        |:Dispatch|.

:FocusDispatch          Show the task that would run when calling |:Dispatch|
                        with no arguments.

                                                *dispatch-:Start*
:Start {command}        Start a process in a new, focused window.

:Start! {command}       Start a process in a new, unfocused window.

:Start[!] -title={title} {command}
                        Start a process in a window titled {title}.  This is
                        not normally used interactively.

STRATEGIES                                      *dispatch-strategies*

Strategies are listed in order of precedence.  The first available one is
used.  Some strategies only provide for a subset of tasks.

Tmux ~

Foreground makes open in a small split at the bottom.  The closure of the
pane triggers a |VimResized| event which loads the results into the quickfix
list.  (All other strategies use the GUI subsystem to get this to work.)

The tmux strategy can be used from the GUI as well.  Either start Vim from
inside of tmux or assign g:tmux_session.  This will use a new window for
foreground makes rather than a split.

GNU Screen ~

Not used for foreground |:Make| invocations unless you're in GUI Vim.

Windows ~

You can use either the standard cmd.exe or a cygwin shell.  Both foreground
and background |:Make| invocations are started minimized to prevent focus
stealing.

iTerm ~

This strategy fires if you're in MacVim with at least one iTerm window open,
or if Vim is running in iTerm itself.  In the latter case, you can't use it
for foreground |:Make| invocations.

X11 ~

Uses $TERMINAL, x-terminal-emulator, or xterm.  Used only for |:Start|, as its
insistence on stealing focus makes it infuriating for much else.

Headless ~

Forks tasks into the background.  It's working, you just can't see it.  Don't
forget to check |:Copen|.  The presence of this strategy means that |:Make!|
and |:Start!| will never block Vim.

Synchronous ~

When all else fails, a vanilla |:make| or |:!| is performed.
